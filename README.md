# IMMI-Case - Immigration Case Downloader & Manager

A Python tool to download, extract, browse, and manage Australian immigration, home affairs, and refugee-related court and tribunal appeal cases from 2000 to present.

Includes a **React SPA** (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4) and a **Flask API** for searching, browsing, editing, and exporting cases. Also synced to **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for cloud access.

## Data

- **149,016 cases** across 9 courts/tribunals (2000–2026)
- **148,966 with full text** (99.96%) — ~1.9 GB on disk
- **29 data fields** per case (metadata + structured extraction + annotations)
- Synced to Supabase Cloud (Project: Bsmart)

| Court/Tribunal | Code | Cases | Years |
|----------------|------|-------|-------|
| Migration Review Tribunal | MRTA | 52,970 | 2000–2015 |
| Administrative Appeals Tribunal | AATA | 39,203 | 2000–2024 |
| Federal Court of Australia | FCA | 14,987 | 2000– |
| Refugee Review Tribunal | RRTA | 13,765 | 2000–2015 |

> **Court lineage**: FMCA → FCCA → FedCFamC2G (lower court); MRTA+RRTA → AATA → ARTA (tribunal). AATA was abolished Oct 2024; use ARTA for 2025+ cases.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For React frontend development
cd frontend && npm install
```

## Web Interface

Start the web interface:

```bash
python web.py --port 8080        # http://localhost:8080/app/
python web.py --debug             # Debug mode
```

The React SPA is served at `/app/` and the API at `/api/v1/*`. Legacy Jinja2 templates remain accessible at the original routes (`/`, `/cases`, etc.).

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev                       # Vite dev server with HMR
npm run build                     # Production build → static/react/

## Analytics & Intelligence Features

The **Analytics page** (`/analytics`) provides lawyer-focused insights:

- **Success Rate Calculator**: Filter by court, year range, visa subclass, case nature, legal concepts → shows win rate + confidence (High: N>100, Medium: N>50, Low: N<50)
- **Outcome Analysis**: Distribution charts, court comparison, nature×outcome heatmap
- **Judge Analysis**: Win rates by judge, court benchmark comparison, judge-to-judge comparison
- **Concept Intelligence**: Legal concept effectiveness, concept trend lines (2000–2026), emerging concepts

**Key data points** (149,016 cases):
- 9 courts/tribunals, 8 outcome types (Affirmed 40%, Remitted 23%, Dismissed 16%...)
- 20+ visa subclasses (Subclass 866 Refugee most common at 30%)

- 20+ legal concepts, 15,465 unique judge/member names

## Smart Pipeline

The Smart Pipeline provides a 3-phase automated workflow:

1. **Crawl** — Scrape case metadata from AustLII (year listing → viewdb → keyword search fallback)
2. **Clean** — Deduplicate, fill missing fields, validate data
3. **Download** — Bulk download full case texts (resumable, saves every 200)

## Supabase Cloud

Cases are synced to Supabase (PostgreSQL) for cloud access:

```bash
python migrate_csv_to_supabase.py           # Full sync (upsert all 149,016 cases)
python migrate_csv_to_supabase.py --dry-run # Count only
```

- Project: Bsmart (`urntbuqczarkuoaosjxd`)
- Schema: 5 migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
- All 29 fields available, native full-text search via `to_tsvector`

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Backend** | Python 3, Flask, pandas, BeautifulSoup/lxml |
| **Frontend** | React 18, TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, TanStack Query, Recharts, Sonner |
| **Storage** | CSV/JSON (default), SQLite (FTS5+WAL), Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| **Testing** | pytest (296 unit tests), Playwright (231 E2E tests) |
| **LLM** | Claude Sonnet (field extraction), 10 parallel sub-agents |
| **Scraper** | Cloudflare Workers + R2 (bulk), AustLII direct scraping |

## Rate Limiting

Built-in rate limiting (default: 1 second between requests). AustLII blocks default `python-requests` User-Agent (HTTP 410) — the scraper uses a browser-like UA string. Bulk scraping may trigger IP blocks; typically resolves within hours.
