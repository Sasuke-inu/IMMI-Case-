and\n(b)\nis taken to be, and always to have been, a valid application\n(a\nconverted application\n) for a visa of a different class (specified by the\nconversion regulation) made by the applicant for the pre\n-\nconversion visa.\nNote:\nThis section may apply in relation to a pre\n-\nconversion\napplication made before the commencement of the section (see the\nMigration and\nMaritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload)\nAct 2014\n).\nFor example, a conversion regulation (made after the commencement of\nthis section) could have the effect that a pre\n-\nconversion application for a\nparticular type of visa made on 1\nAugust 2014 (before that\ncommencement):\n(a)\nis taken not to have been made on 1\nAugust 2014 (or ever);\nand\n(b)\nis taken to be, and always to have been, a converted application\nfor another type of visa made on 1\nAugust 2014.\n(4)\nWithout limiting\nsubsection\n(3), a conversion\nregulation may:\n(a)\nprescribe a class or classes of pre\n-\nconversion visas; and\n(b)\nprescribe a class of applicants for pre\n-\nconversion visas;\nand\n(c)\nprescribe a time (the\nconversion time\n) when the regulation\nis to start to apply in relation to a pre\n-\nconversion application, including\ndifferent conversion times depending on the occurrence of different events.\nVisa application charge\n(5)\nIf an amount has been paid as the first instalment of the\nvisa application charge for a pre\n-\nconversion application, then, at and after\nthe conversion time in relation to the application:\n(a)\nthat payment is taken not to have been paid as the first\ninstalment of the visa application charge for the pre\n-\nconversion\napplication; and\n(b)\nthat payment is taken to be payment of the first instalment\nof the visa application charge for the converted application, even if the\nfirst instalment of the visa application charge that would otherwise be\npayable for the converted application is greater than the actual amount paid\nfor the first instalment of the visa application charge for the pre\n-\nconversion application; and\n(c)\nin a case in which the first instalment of the visa\napplication charge payable for the converted application is less than the\nactual amount paid for the first instalment of the visa application charge for\nthe pre\n-\nconversion application, no refund is payable in respect of the\ndifference only for that reason.\nNote:\nFor the visa application charge, see sections\n45A\n,\n45B\nand\n45C\n.\nEffect on bridging visas\n(6)\nFor the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the\nconversion time for a pre\n-\nconversion application, a person held a bridging\nvisa because the pre\n-\nconversion application had not been finally determined,\nthen, at and after the conversion time, the bridging visa has effect as if it\nhad been granted because of the converted application.\n(7)\nFor the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the\nconversion time for a pre\n-\nconversion application, a person had made an\napplication for a bridging visa because of the pre\n-\nconversion application,\nbut the bridging visa application had not been finally determined, then, at\nand after the conversion time:\n(a)\nthe bridging visa application is taken to have been applied\nfor because of the converted application; and\n(b)\nthe bridging visa (if granted) has effect as if it were\ngranted because of the converted application.\nNote:\nThis Act and the regulations would apply to a bridging visa to\nwhich\nsubsection\n(6) or (7) applies, and to when the bridging visa\nwould cease to have effect, in the same way as this Act and the regulations\nwould apply in relation to any bridging visa.\nFor example, such a bridging visa would generally cease to be in effect\nunder section\n82\nif and when the substantive visa is granted because of\nthe converted application.\nConversion regulation may affect accrued rights etc.\n(8)\nTo avoid doubt:\n(a)\nsubsection\n12(2) (retrospective application of\nlegislative instruments) of the\nLegislation Act 2003\ndoes not apply in\nrelation to the effect of a conversion regulation (including a conversion\nregulation enacted by the\nParliament\n); and\n(b)\nsubsection\n7(2) of the\nActs Interpretation Act 1901\n,\nincluding that\nsubsection\nas applied by section\n13\nof the\nLegislation Act 2003\n, does not apply in relation to the enactment of this\nsection or the making of a conversion regulation (including a conversion\nregulation enacted by the\nParliament\n)."

The Minister refuses to grant each applicant the visa and\ngives notice of the refusal decision to each applicant. The notice states that\nthe applicant may make an application for review of the refusal decision\nwithin 30 days after the notice is received by the applicant.\nWhile the notice substantially complies with the requirement in the Act\nto state the period within which an application for review must be made, the\nnotice misstates the period. The correct period is 28 days after the notice is\nreceived by the applicant.\nAndrew makes an application for review of the refusal decision 25 days\nafter receiving the notice. As the misstatement in the notice does not cause\nsubstantial prejudice to Andrew's right to seek review, it is intended\nthat\nsubsection\n(2) would apply in relation to the notice given to\nAndrew.\nGeorge makes an application for review of the refusal decision 29 days\nafter receiving the notice. The misstatement in the notice causes substantial\nprejudice to George's right to seek review as the application for review\nis not made within the required period but is made within the misstated period\nspecified in the notice. It is intended that\nsubsection\n(2) would not\napply in relation to the notice given to George.\nDaniel makes an application for review of the refusal decision 40 days\nafter receiving the notice. The misstatement in the notice does not cause\nsubstantial prejudice to Daniel's right to seek review as the application\nfor review is made well after the required period. It is intended that\nsubsection\n(2) would apply in relation to the notice given to Daniel.\nExample 2:\nAnne applies for a visa and has an authorised recipient\nunder section\n494D.\nThe Minister refuses to grant Anne the visa and\ngives notice of the refusal decision by sending an email to the authorised\nrecipient. The authorised recipient receives the notice and 2 days later\nforwards it on to Anne.\nThe notice states that Anne may make an application for review of the\nrefusal decision within 21 days after the day Anne receives the notice. The\nnotice does not explain that the effect of sections\n494C\nand\n494D\nis\nthat the period of 21 days begins to run on the day after the day the notice\nis received by the authorised recipient, rather than by Anne.\nWhile the notice substantially complies with the requirement in the Act\nto state the period within which an application for review must be made, the\nnotice misdescribes when that period begins to run.\nAnne makes an application for review of the refusal decision 35 days\nafter receiving the notice. The misdescription in the notice does not cause\nsubstantial prejudice to Anne's right to seek review as the application\nfor review is made well after the required period. It is intended that\nsubsection\n(2) would apply in relation to the notice given to the\nauthorised recipient."

For example, standard requirements apply to\napplications to the\nTribunal\n, but other legislation may specify additional or\nalternative\nrequirements.\nPractice directions\nmade by the\nPresident\nalso deal\nwith various matters relating to\nTribunal\nproceedings and operations.\nPractice directions\nmust be published.\nThe\nPresident\ndecides which\nmember\nor\nmembers\nwill exercise the\nTribunal\n's powers for a specific proceeding.\nThis is referred to as constituting the\nTribunal\nfor the purposes of the\nproceeding. There are different requirements for constituting the\nTribunal\nfor\ndifferent kinds of proceedings. For other ways the\nTribunal\n's powers can\nbe exercised, see Division\n4 of Part\n11.\nGeneral principles (for\nexample in relation to accessibility and informality) apply to how the\nTribunal\nruns proceedings. Specific requirements also apply to the\nTribunal\n,\napplicants,\ndecision\n-\nmakers and other parties to proceedings. There are\nprovisions dealing with the following:\n(a)\nparticipating in\nproceedings, including representation;\n(b)\nways for parties to\nstop participating;\n(c)\nhearings, directions hearings and\ndispute resolution processes\n(together known as\nTribunal case events\n);\n(d)\nobtaining and managing evidence and information, including public\ninterest certificates;\n(e)\norders the\nTribunal\nmay make in\nrelation to proceedings.\nThe\nTribunal\nmay dismiss an application without\nmaking a\ndecision\nin some circumstances. Otherwise, in a review of a\nreviewable decision\n, the\nTribunal\nmust affirm, vary or set aside the\ndecision\n.\nIf the\nTribunal\nsets aside the\ndecision\n, it may make a substitute\ndecision\nor\nremit the matter to the\ndecision\n-\nmaker to reconsider as ordered or\nrecommended by the\nTribunal\n.\nThe timing and effect of some\nTribunal\ndecisions\nis set out. Once\ndecisions\nare made, requirements apply to the\nTribunal\nin\nrelation to giving notice, giving statements of reasons and publishing\ndecisions\n.\nSome\nguidance and appeals panel\ndecisions\nare specified to be\nTribunal guidance decisions\n. The\nTribunal\nmust have regard to these\ndecisions\nin some future proceedings.\nThere are a number of offences applying to giving\nevidence, non\n-\npublication and non\n-\ndisclosure orders and contempt."
